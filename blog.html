	<p>Before we look at the exception classes in Java, let’s understand the two categories of exceptions in Java:Checked exceptions – You must check and handle these in your program. For example, if you are using an API that has a method which declares that it could throw a checked exception, you must catch the exception each time you call that method. If you don’t, the compiler will notice and your program will not compile. The designers of the Java wanted to encourage developers to use checked exceptions in situations from which programs may wish to recover: for example, if the host is down, the program may wish to try another address.

<p class="quote">Unchecked exceptions on the other hand are not required to be handled or caught in the program. For example, if a method could throw unchecked exceptions, the caller of the method is not required to handle or catch the exceptions.</p>

<p>Remember: Checked exceptions are mild and normally programs wish to recover. They must be caught and this rule is enforced by the compiler. The compiler doesn’t care whether you do or do not catch unchecked exceptions.</p>
